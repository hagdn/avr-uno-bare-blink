# avr-uno-bare-blink
This is a simple code that makes use of registers. It's my first code diving into bare metal programming.
The Makefile is a personal creation of mine through trial and error and reviewing C-language compilation
an linking process.

This code makes use of the built-in LED on the Arduino-Uno board. This code can be directly uploaded to the Arduino-Uno through
the USB cable that comes with it, the uploading does not erase the bootloader so be at ease if you still want to program the
board with the USB cable.
